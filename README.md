SqueezeBox.js
=============

SqueezeBox.js is a javascript parser, tokenized, minimizer, compressor, beautifier, expander, mapper tool.  I created this to implant in my brain real javascript syntax rules rather than the common ones believed by most of the scripting / programming / developer community.  If you understand about newlines, semi-colons and auto-insertion, then you know what I am talking about.
